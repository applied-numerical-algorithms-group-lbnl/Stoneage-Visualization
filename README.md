# Stoneage-Visualization
These are some very basic routines that allow visualization of Chombo data files without installing anything special.
Pseudocarpet makes a colored carpet plot of the data.   Postscript_plot makes postscript files of the pictured data. 
The command line arguments are displayed when you run the programs.

This is intended for Chombo 3 data files.   Chombo 3 users will recognize the makefile format.

Chombo 4 versions are upcoming.
